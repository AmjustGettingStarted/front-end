# 🌐 What is React.js?

**React.js** (often just called **React**) is a popular, open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs).

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **🧩 Component-Based Architecture**
  - UI elements are built as reusable components, making development more efficient and modular.

- **🔁 Declarative Syntax**
  - Developers describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the updates when data changes.

- **🌪️ Virtual DOM**
  - React uses a lightweight, virtual representation of the DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance.

- **➡️ Unidirectional Data Flow**
  - Data flows in one direction (from parent to child), making application state easier to manage and debug.

- **🔌 Rich Ecosystem**
  - Compatible with libraries and tools like Redux, React Router, Next.js, and more.
