# 🌐 What is React.js?

**React.js** (often just called **React**) is a popular, open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs).

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **🧩 Component-Based Architecture**

  - UI elements are built as reusable components, making development more efficient and modular.

- **🔁 Declarative Syntax**

  - Developers describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the updates when data changes.

- **🌪️ Virtual DOM**

  - React uses a lightweight, virtual representation of the DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance.

- **➡️ Unidirectional Data Flow**

  - Data flows in one direction (from parent to child), making application state easier to manage and debug.

- **🔌 Rich Ecosystem**
  - Compatible with libraries and tools like Redux, React Router, Next.js, and more.

## 🧠 Why Use React?

- High performance for dynamic apps
- Huge developer community
- Easy to scale with modular components
- Supported by major tech companies

Absolutely! Here's a solid set of **topic-wise basic React.js interview questions and answers** to kick things off. We'll start with the **"Basics of React.js"** as requested:

---

### 🔹 1. What is React.js?

**Answer:**  
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to build reusable UI components that efficiently update and render based on data changes.

---

### 🔹 2. What are the key features of React.js?

**Answer:**

- **Component-based architecture**: Reusable and modular code.
- **Virtual DOM**: Improves performance by updating only parts of the real DOM.
- **Declarative syntax**: Describes UI based on the application state.
- **Unidirectional data flow**: Easier state management and debugging.
- **Rich ecosystem**: Integrates with Redux, React Router, Next.js, etc.

### 🔹 3. How is React different from traditional JavaScript frameworks?

**Answer:**

- React uses a **virtual DOM** for faster rendering.
- It focuses purely on the **view layer**, making it easy to integrate with other libraries.
- React follows a **component-based** model, improving code reusability.

### 🔹 4. What is JSX?

**Answer:**  
JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. It allows writing HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code. It's not necessary for React, but it makes component creation easier and more intuitive.

---

### 🔹 5. Is React a library or a framework?

**Answer:**  
React is a **library**, not a full framework. It’s focused on building UI and can be combined with other tools (like Redux and React Router) to create a more complete development experience..
